# Content Review - Spring Boot project

- A content creator review site where users can review creators on Twitch.tv
- Each review itself has the ability to be upvoted and upvotes degrade over time
- Uses Twitch API for finding streamers and for statistics

## **Uses:**

- React
- Springboot
- Axios
- Material-ui

## **Set up and run**

- /TwitchReviewBackend is run within Java IDE that sets up springboot
- `npm start` runs in terminal hard within /frontend 

## **Planning**

- Used Excalidraw to diagram and wireframe

## **Problems encountered**

- Was supposed to be a group project but ended up being solo so had trouble finishing within time required and thus a WIP
- Was also a consolidation of a previous Java module that due to Covid became partly a learn by doing project

## **Things learned**

- If using React actually create a component model before any code is written!
- When working to a deadline and working capacity down, focus on MVP (make a list of critical tasks) and don't start forcing in unfamiliar tools and tech
